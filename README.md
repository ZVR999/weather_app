# weather_app
Simple weather app to practice AJAX/jQuery

To use this weather app. Simply type just the name of any city or state in the U.S. Capitalizing the first letter. i.e."Chicago" or 
"Pawnee" 

I will come back and fix the issues with the name capitalization, space, areas outside the U.S. etc. After I've graduated from Coding Dojo
as I can see this as a fun little project to display :)
