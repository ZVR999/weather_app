# weather_app
Simple weather app to practice AJAX/jQuery

To use this weather app. Simply type just the name of any city or state in the U.S. I.E."Chicago", "New York", "Pawnee", etc.

I will come back and fix the issues with the spaces, areas outside the U.S. etc. After I've graduated from Coding Dojo
as I can see this as a fun little project to display :)
